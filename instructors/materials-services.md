IQMR 2025 is innovating in a number of ways related to materials provision. This section outlines those changes, and offers additional information on technology and services.

## Elimination of Paper

Please note that beginning in 2025, IQMR is seeking to eliminate paper whenever possible. For instance, you will no longer be provided upon arrival at the Institute with copies of the research designs to be presented in the research design sessions that you are chairing, or a copy of the IQMR face book. (The forests thank you for your understanding.)

## Printing

Unfortunately, there are no printing services available to IQMR instructors. If you would like to be able to access paper copies of any materials, please print them at home and bring them with you to Syracuse.

## Materials Storage

In 2025, IQMR is transitioning from using BlackBoard to store module readings, materials, and associated powerpoint slides to using Zotero to store these items. IQMR will manage the Zotero library and ensure that all materials are available to IQMR participants (and only to IQMR participants). We simply ask that you send us the materials that you would like distributed via Zotero following the timeline outlined above.

## Accessing Your Powerpoint Slides to Teach

In order to project your powerpoint slides while teaching, the easiest solution is for you to **bring your slides with you to the Institute on a USB/flashdrive.** The computers in the classrooms we will use will have a place for you to insert the drive and access your slides. A member of the IQMR team will be available in case you need assistance.

## Internet Access
Syracuse University has switched to an open wireless network, AirOrangeX, for the entire campus. You can connect to the network without additional login.
