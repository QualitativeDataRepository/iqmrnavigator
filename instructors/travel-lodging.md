Christiane Pagé, Associate Director of the Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method Inquiry at Syracuse University, will make your hotel reservations, will also arrange for you to be reimbursed for your travel costs after the Institute, and can answer any questions you have about travel or lodging.

Travel
------

Syracuse is located approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City.

As indicated in your "Letter of Engagement" from Syracuse University, we ask that you please **book your own round-trip economy class travel** to and from Syracuse, securing the most economical rate that you can. IQMR will cover the cost of your transportation via reimbursement after the Institute (see "[Per Diem, Travel Reimbursement, and Honoraria](/instructors/honoraria-logistics)" for more details).

Because modules start early in the morning each day, we ask that you please **arrive the day prior to the start of your module sequence**. Likewise, as it is important that you stay through to the end of your last module on your last day of teaching, you may need to depart Syracuse the day after your sequence concludes.

If you are flying, please book your flights into and out of [Syracuse Hancock International Airport](https://syrairport.org/){:target="_blank"} (SYR). The airport has a single terminal divided into separate concourses. The airport is about 10 miles (15-minute drive) from the university. Taxis are available; it may be easier to call an Uber or Lyft to get from the airport to the university. You can also book the airport shuttle provided by Collegian Hotel starting Thursday, June 12 (or, for those teaching in the second week, Thursday, June 19), when the hotel posts the schedule for the next week. Call 315-476-4212 and press \#2 for the front desk to reserve a spot on the airport shuttle.

If you drive to Syracuse, we will reimburse for roundtrip mileage from your home to Syracuse at the Syracuse University rate. Parking is free at the Collegian Hotel, where you will be staying (see below).

Please make travel arrangements as soon as you can, and by no later than **May 15**.
-   If you are flying domestically, please check with Christiane before booking round-trip travel costing more than \$800.
-   If you are flying internationally, please check with Christiane before booking round-trip travel costing more than \$1,500.
-   Please check with Christiane Pagé ([cmpage@syr.edu](mailto:cmpage@syr.edu)) if your IQMR flights fall in or between other flight needs so we can agree in advance the legs of the trip for which IQMR will pay.


We will request some information about your flights (if you are flying) and arrival and departure dates through a brief survey we will distribute closer to the Institute.

Please keep the [Syracuse University Travel Policy](https://policies.syr.edu/policies/administrative-and-financial/travel-policy/){:target="_blank"} in mind as you make your arrangements. The policies outlined on the linked web page govern the payment of or reimbursement for business-related travel expenses.

Hotel
-----

We will make a hotel reservation for you at [The Collegian, in close proximity to campus](https://scholarhotels.com/scholar-hotel-syracuse/){:target="_blank"}. The street address is 1060 E Genesee St, Syracuse, New York 13210.

Unless you tell us otherwise, we will reserve a room for you from the night before your module sequence begins through the evening of the last day of your module sequence. Please be in touch with Christiane ([cmpage@syr.edu](mailto:cmpage@syr.edu)) with any questions about the hotel or to let us know that your arrival and departure dates differ from the default just mentioned.

You can check into the hotel beginning at 3:00pm. Early check-in at no extra cost is an option starting at 1:30pm based on availability. Check out is at 12 noon.

Upon arrival, the hotel will ask you for a credit card which will be charged for incidental expenses.

Parking is free at the hotel. To maximize safety and security, we recommend not leaving anything of value in your car parked in the Collegian parking lot.
