title: Honorarium Payment, Per Diem, and Travel Reimbursement 
---

IQMR will pay you an honorarium for teaching at the Institute, as well as a per diem, and will reimburse your travel to and from Syracuse. We will ask you to complete the required paperwork and forms while you are in Syracuse. We will seek to pay and reimburse you within two months following the end of the Institute, but please note that time frames for processing honoraria can vary. Instructors residing in the U.S. will be paid by check; instructors residing outside the U.S. (or who are otherwise not tax-residents of the U.S.) will be paid by foreign bank e-transfers. More information on the latter category [can be found on this web page](https://finance.syr.edu/comptroller/payroll/payroll-for-foreign-non-resident-employees/){:target="_blank"}.

Instructors who participate in the unified sessions on the first day of IQMR are paid an additional US\$500.

Instructors are compensated an additional \$350 for each research design session they lead.

## Per Diem

Beginning in 2025, IQMR instructors are reimbursed for meals that the Institute does not provide and other incidentals via a fixed per diem based on the [ GSA rate for meals and incidentals for Syracuse](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-results?fiscal_year=2024&state=NY&perdiemSearchVO_city=syracuse&action=perdiems_report&zip=&op=Find+Rates&form_build_id=form-qZpQ5pRIvtMSNASLi8edculZ7y5X_UCRrHlRCtiG8P4&form_id=perdiem_form){:target="_blank"}. You do not need to keep or submit receipts. You are responsible for the payment of any federal, state, or local taxes, or any other taxes that may be payable in respect to all amounts received as part of this agreement.

## Travel Reimbursement

If you are flying to Syracuse, you will be reimbursed for your round-trip economy class flight. You will also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses for your ground transportation to and from the airports included in your trip.

If driving your own vehicle to Syracuse, the University will reimburse you at its mileage rate then in force. Travel must be commensurate with the terms [set forth in the University's travel policy](https://policies.syr.edu/policies/administrative-and-financial/travel-policy/){:target="_blank"}.

## Paperwork and Forms

Choose from W-9 or W-8BEN (consult your accountant if you have any questions). The payee is responsible to know their tax status and appropriate withholding form to file, and should consult their tax advisor for guidance if needed.
-   [W-8BEN](https://finance.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fw8ben.pdf){:target="_blank"} \[PDF\] form (Part I and Part III only) to claim nonresident tax status
-   [W-9 form](https://finance.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fw9.pdf){:target="_blank"} \[PDF\] to claim resident tax status by virtue of being in the U.S. long enough to pass the IRS Substantial Presence Test (SPT)
