Designing and Teaching Your Module Sequence, Modules, and Sessions
------------------------------------------------------------------

The first, third, and fourth sessions of each instructional day at IQMR are reserved for your modules. Each session is 90 minutes long. Thus, you will have 270 minutes of instruction time each day. [More about designing and teaching](/instructors/designing-teaching) your module sequences, modules, and sessions.

Materials, Technology, and Services
-----------------------------------

IQMR 2025 is innovating in a number of ways related to materials provision. [More about those changes, and additional information](/instructors/materials-service.md) on technology and services.

Chairing Research Design Sessions
---------------------------------

Unless you have actively opted not to do so, we will ask each instructor to chair a research design discussion session on each day that they teach. More about [research design sessions, and chairing them](/instructors/chairing-research-design).

Interactions Beyond Teaching and Research Design Sessions
---------------------------------------------------------

Beyond your modules and the research design discussions you lead, we encourage you to capitalize on the presence of faculty colleagues, engaging with them, going to dinner together in the evenings, etc. We also encourage you to interact with the participants as much as possible, and to let them know that you are open to engaging with them. Your time at IQMR will be exhausting, but the Institute, the knowledge gained, and the connections made can make a massive difference in participants' intellectual trajectory.

Code of Conduct
---------------

Syracuse University policies set parameters for all University community members, and while participating in IQMR, you are subject to [relevant University policies](https://policies.syr.edu/){:target="_blank"}, including those [governing the conduct of regular faculty](https://academicaffairs.syracuse.edu/faculty-affairs/policies-and-procedures/faculty-manual/4-1-inappropriate-conduct-by-faculty-members/){:target="_blank"}. The University may address potential violations of University policies according to terms or procedures separate from those listed in the policies, as you are considered a guest and independent contractor, and not a University employee. The University may discontinue its relationship with you at any time for any reason.

Travel and Hotel
------
Christiane Pag√©, Associate Director of the Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method Inquiry at Syracuse University, can answer any questions you have about making your travel arrangements. Christiane will also arrange for you to be reimbursed for your travel costs after the Institute. [More about travel to and lodging](/instructors/travel-lodging) in Syracuse. 

Dining
------

On each instructional day, we will provide a breakfast buffet and two coffee breaks with snacks. There will also be a few organized dinners. The per diem with which we will provide you can be used to cover the cost of meals not provided by IQMR (see under "Honoraria, Per Diem, and Travel Reimbursement" for more details). The "Syracuse Dining and Entertainment" (to come) page on this website offers information about restaurants and other attractions in Syracuse.

Honorarium Payment, Per Diem, and Travel Reimbursement 
------------------------------------------------------

IQMR will pay you an honorarium for teaching at the Institute, as well as a per diem, and will reimburse your travel to and from Syracuse. [More about honoraria and reimburesement](/instructors/honoraria-logistics).

Evaluation
----------

IQMR participants are offered the opportunity to evaluate IQMR constantly throughout the Institute. They are sent surveys to complete at the conclusion of each module, and they complete an exit survey at the close of the Institute. IQMR leadership reviews this feedback and distributes it to instructors in the months following the Institute. Instructors are encouraged to carefully review the feedback and keep it in mind in subsequent teaching opportunities at IQMR.
