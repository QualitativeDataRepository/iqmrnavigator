title: Choosing Which Modules to Take
---

A typical instructional day at IQMR comprises three 90-minute instructional sessions focused on a particular topic (a "module") (as well as breaks and a research design discussion group session, outlined below). On most days, participants choose one from among four modules (e.g., process tracing, different fieldwork techniques, or text as data). Thus for the nine instructional days (excluding the first Sunday), participants will select nine modules to take from the 36 offered.

You can find the [IQMR 2025 schedule](/schedule) here. Each module name is linked to an underlying page that contextualizes the module in the module sequence of which it forms part, including a description of all of the included modules; a description of the sessions that form each module; and required and recommended readings for each session. We will add information over time; full information on the entire curriculum will be available in May 2025. The module selection form will open on May 20 and must be completed by **June 3**. Instructions for choosing which modules to take will be added here.

Most topics are taught over more than one day (a "module sequence"). Faculty teaching these module sequences have particular preferences for whether students can join the module after it has begun. These preferences are indicated in bold on the webpage of this Navigator site that outines the modules and sessions and readings of that module sequence. **Please respect the faculty's preferences**.
