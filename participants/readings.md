SUPPORTING MATERIALS -- READINGS AND MORE
=========================================

It is very important that you do as much of the required reading as possible before the Institute, leaving yourself time to network, interact with faculty and colleagues, socialize, relax, and enjoy your down time when you are at IQMR.

Please remember that IQMR's reserves are for your use only.

We will try to make all readings (and other supporting materials for IQMR 2025 available on IQMR's section of Syracuse University\'s Blackboard website by May 2025. If a reading is marked, "reading to be added" on the reading list (see specific Module Sequence pages on this website). we will add it as soon as possible.

Some of the modules require you to read multiple chapters from the same book. For those modules, we ask you to obtain the book. Many of these required books are available online from the Syracuse University library. You should be able to access them there via the links we have included on Blackboard.

Please remember that you are NOT responsible for readings listed as "recommended." (For your convenience, we included some of those materials on Blackboard, but please [don't]{.underline} interpret that as meaning you are obliged to read them.)

BOOKS TO PURCHASE OR BORROW FROM THE LIBRARY AT YOUR HOME INSTITUTION

The readings for some modules include a book or books that must be purchased, or borrowed from your university library. Please note that, except for the books that are available as ebooks/pdfs, they are unlikely to be available at the Syracuse University bookstore or library. Note that some books are used in more than one module.

MANUSCRIPTS IN PRESS OR IN PROGRESS

To the extent possible, IQMR uses the most up-to-date readings on the methods covered at the Institute. One consequence is that we often use manuscripts that are either in press or in progress. Please note that the authors are allowing us to use these materials as a courtesy. As with all IQMR materials, they are made available [for current attendees' use only]{.underline}.

        -   Enter your Syracuse University email address.

            -   Your Syracuse University email is your NetID plus \@syr.edu.
