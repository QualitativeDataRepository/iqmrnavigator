title: LODGING &ndash; MILTON HALL
---

All IQMR attendees will stay in two or four-bedroom suites in [Milton Hall](https://housingmealplans.syr.edu/residential-facilities/apartment-housing/milton-hall/), a modern dormitory on the Syracuse University campus. Learn a little about the background of your temporary home [in this article](https://news.syr.edu/blog/2025/06/02/the-milton-legacy-romance-success-and-giving-back/){:target="_blank"}!

Milton Hall's street address is **727 South Crouse Ave**., Syracuse, New York 13244. The hall is centrally located adjacent to Marshall Street, a popular commercial area for shopping and dining. The main entrance is a few steps down the wide pedestrian walkway at the intersection of 727 South Crouse and the “Five Guys” restaurant adjacent to the building. There is a “drop-off” spot for ubers/taxis in front of the “Five Guys.” 


<!--- Milton Hall amenities include a fitness center, laundry room, study areas, and entertainment areas. (You can also go to a local laundromat.) --->
Each suite includes a full kitchen. Additionally, each bedroom has a full bathroom. Please note that Milton Hall does not have cleaning services; it is up to you to keep your apartment clean and tidy.

IQMR will provide you with the following items, so you do not need to bring these with you:
- Towels
- Bedsheets / blankets
- One pillow
- Cleaning materials (one set per apartment)
    - Sponge
    - Dishwashing detergent (small)
- A plate, a bowl, a cup, silverware
- Toilet paper

Please plan to bring with you – or buy once in Syracuse – any other items that you need. There is a CVS pharmacy across the street (700 South Crouse Avenue) where you can get any needed supplies on arrival.

Milton Hall includes several types of amenities, but you do not have access to all of them. To access all of the amenities, you need to take the elevator to the basement of Milton – none of the amenities is on the lobby level or the apartment floors. Please be courteous and make sure that you clean up after yourselves when you use a common space!

You **DO have access** to the large entertainment gathering space and the study rooms.  

You **also have access** to the laundry facilities (which include about 15 sets of washers and dryers and which are free for you to use). If you plan to do laundry while in Syracuse, you will need to bring or buy laundry detergent.  

You **DO NOT have access** to the gym in Milton.  There are gym facilities available for your use in a different building on campus, the [Barnes Center](https://experience.syracuse.edu/bewell/), a few minutes walk from the building in which modules will be held. See [this page of this website](/participants/syracuse-university) which has more information on these gym facilities. 

IQMR will assign participants to apartments in Milton Hall based on a survey to solicit information from you to help us to do so (e.g., if there is anyone with whom you would like to share an apartment, whether you prefer a two- or four-person apartment, if you would prefer to stay in an apartment with people whose gender identification matches yours, etc.).

Please note that your room in Milton Hall is for occupation by you alone, not friends, spouses, children, etc.

Milton Hall does not permit pets. Also, Syracuse University campus and housing are tobacco free. Please refer to the [Campus Housing Safety Guidelines](https://dps.syr.edu/crime-prevention/safety-strategies/campus-housing-safety-guidelines/) for more information on lodging at Syracuse University and the [Syracuse University Student Code of Conduct](https://experience.syracuse.edu/community-standards/conduct-handbook/code-of-student-conduct/) for more information on what items are and are not permitted in Milton Hall.

CHECKING IN AND OUT OF MILTON HALL 
----------------------------------

Most IQMR participants will check into Milton Hall on Saturday, June 14. (A few participants who are traveling internationally will check in on Friday June 13.) If you arrive during normal business hours, there will be an IQMR staff member there to answer questions. 

No matter at what hour you arrive at Milton Hall, there will be a lodging attendant available. If you arrive after normal business hours, you will need to call the on-call attendant; there will be a sign on the entrance door with the on-call phone number. The on-call attendant will be close by, but please be patient if it takes a little while for them to arrive to help you.

When you check in, the lodging attendant will give you your apartment key and your room key anda bag with your towel, linens, and pillow.  **Please don’t lose your keys**; they are very expensive to replace. You will also get your SU ID and other program materials when you check in. In your apartment, you will find your cleaning supplies and plate / bowl cup / utensils and toilet paper.  

### Checking out of Milton Hall

Also, please leave the key and fob with the front desk staff (Usual front desk staff will be on site from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. If you leave at a time outside that window, a small blue bin will be available for you to leave your key and fob in). You may need to put these in an envelope -- available at the front desk -- if you have already discarded or lost the envelope in which your key and fob originally came.
