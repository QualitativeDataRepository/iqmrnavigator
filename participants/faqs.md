## Curriculum and Materials 
{: .module-sub }

  - **I am having a difficult time registering with Syracuse University to obtain my Syracuse University number. What should I do?**
      - You will need to contact the Office of the Registrar at Syracuse University to address this problem. The Registrar has [a wonderful web page](https://registrar.syr.edu/) with a lot of information, and you can also call them at (315) 443-2422.


  - **Will the modules run at the same time, or is it possible to attend sessions from different modules?**
      - Modules listed on the same date on the schedule run at the same time, so you have to choose one of the four for every day (see also [https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/choosing-modules](https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/choosing-modules) ).


  - **Can I switch between modules on the same day? There is a session in a different module that I’m very interested in.**
      - We ask that you attend all sessions of the module you are signed up for on a given day: instructors do need some continuity among participants to teach effectively. There is bound to be stuff you are interested in in simultaneous modules. You will have access to all slides and readings via Zotero and can ask other participants for notes.

 
  - **Do I need to purchase any materials in advance?**
      - Some modules require one book for purchase. Some of these books are available as e-books through Syracuse University (I believe you will be able to access them already using your netID). Those books are listed at the top of the respective module sequence description on navigator.

  - **Will video recordings be made available of the modules?""
      - Modules will not be recorded for later access. However, slides will be made available via Zotero 24 hours in advance of the start of the module. We ask participants to not video or audio record module sessions. 

  - **Will there be final assessments for the modules, and will each instructor define them individually?**
      - There is no assessment. This is a summer institute, *not* summer classes, and you will receive no credit (though there is a certificate of attendance). The expectation (and our experience) is that participants come eager to learn and don’t require additional incentives or testing.


## Research Designs
{: .module-sub }


  - **Do I have to submit a research design for presentation at IQMR?**   
      - Yes, submitting a research design is required. You might submit a shorter (“proto’) research design, a full-length research design. Please see the instructions on [this Navigator page](https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/research-design-instructions).


  - **Do I need to attend a research design session – in which I comment on other people’s designs, every day?**  
      - Research design sessions are held on every instructional day with the exception of the first Sunday and the last Friday, so eight days total. We expect you to sign up for research design session on five of those days – in addition to the session in which you present your research design (so you’ll attend a total of six sessions). Participants will be given the opportunity to opt out of two research design sessions. Participating in these sessions is a great way both to learn from and about what others do and to give constructive feedback, not to mention how much it benefits the recipients.


  - **I indicated that I would submit a full/proto research design on the initial form. Can I submit a proto/full design instead_**
      - Yes. The initial indication gives us a sense of the numbers for planning. That said, the more comprehensive the design you submit, the more useful the feedback you'll receive, so we encourage you to submit a full design if you are on the fence. 


## Logistics
{: .module-sub }

  - **Do I need to arrange health insurance for the duration of the program, or will this be provided?**
      - Yes, please do arrange for health insurance; see [https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/\#medical-insurance](https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/#medical-insurance)


  - **I am traveling from abroad. Could you provide an estimate of expected expenses so I can plan and convert the necessary amount to USD?**
      - Participants selected through the competitive application process (rather than being nominated by their departments) who are receiving a fellowship from IQMR will receive a US$700 prepaid credit card, which should cover regular expenses during the institute. These students should bring some money (e.g., to be able to pay for a cab to campus if needed) yourself, but it needn’t be more than US$100-200 dollars.
      - Participants who were nominated by their department should plan to bring approximately $1,000 with them.
      - It is *possible* to spend more than $1,000 depending upon the activities in which you choose to engage in the evenings and on the weekend (e.g. traveling).
      - If you have a credit card, there is very little in the US for which you can’t use a credit card for.


  - **My flight gets into Syracuse late at night. What do I do?**    
      - You should be able to take a taxi, Uber, or Lyft to the Syracuse University campus. See the “Getting to Syracuse” section of the “[Overview” page](https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/) under “Participant Information.”
      - There is someone on call all day and night at the residence hall at which you will be staying, Milton Hall – see the [“Lodging” page](https://iqmrnavigator.org/participants/lodging) under “Participant Information” for details.
