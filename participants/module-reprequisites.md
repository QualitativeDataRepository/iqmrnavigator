MODULE PREREQUISITES
====================

Some of IQMR's modules require participants to have basic familiarity with R or python. This requirement helps to ensure that the modules are maximally useful for everyone, focusing on methods and techniques, and not basic instruction in how to use the software.

In April, we will ask those who intend to take one of these modules to complete a series of survey questions concerning their familiarity with R or python. Participants who plan to take modules that rely on one or more of these types of software **are required** to either take a short online workshop providing basic familiarity with the software, or demonstrate their pre-existing knowledge of the software, by **June 6, 2025**.

By basic familiarity, we mean that you should understand the software packages, how to install them, and how to use them. For R, for example, you should understand functions, arguments, and objects; be able to interpret information contained in the various windows in RStudio; and know different ways of getting your data \'into R\' and then manipulating it (e.g. adding and dropping columns, changing values in specific cells).

These are the relevant module sequences, tools, prerequisites, and ways to demonstrate that you have completed the prerequisite:

-   M2 / M6 -- Text as Data (Shen-Bayh)

    -   SOFTWARE: Python

    -   Prerequisite: Please read the first 2 chapters of Koskue Imai's *Quantitative Social Science*, a short, self-guided introduction to R, together with a set of online tutorials. In addition, IQMR is providing a short video with some technical information

    -   Demonstration of completion of prerequisite:

-   (Perhaps) M17 / M21 / M25 -- Integrating Qualitative and Experimental Methods (Carter, Crabtree, Rizzo, Tunon)

    -   SOFTWARE: TBD

    -   Prerequisite: TBD

    -   Demonstration of completion of prerequisite: TBD

-   (Perhaps) M29 / M33 -- Geographic Information Systems (Robinson)

    -   SOFTWARE: TBD

    -   Prerequisite: TBD

    -   Demonstration of completion of prerequisite: TBD

-   (Perhaps) M30 / M34 -- Muti-Method Research (Seawright)

    -   SOFTWARE: TBD

    -   Prerequisite: TBD

    -   Demonstration of completion of prerequisite: TBD

IQMR will also offer participants the opportunity to attend drop-in office hours for additional help with some of these software packages. Details on those office hours will be provided here in the coming months.
