title: Registration at Syracuse University
---

This page contains instructions on how to register your Syracuse University identities to access additional IQMR and Syracuse University resources, such as its library. Once the entire process is completed, you will end up with two separate unique identifiers: your Syracuse University NetID and your Syracuse University ID (SUID) number.
 
Please read the instructions carefully before starting.
 
1. Please click this link to register your Syracuse University Identities: [Non-Credit Instructions for Registration](https://professionalstudies.syracuse.edu/academics/non-credit-class-instructions-for-registration/). Once on the page, click on “Register Now” to begin. 
 
2. After you enter your biographic information (be sure to enter your date of birth in the following order: two-digit MONTH, two-digit DAY, four-digit year), disciplinary history, and additional questions, you will see a personal information confirmation page. This page will contain your SUID number (_write this down and save it!_ You will need it to activate your permanent NetID in a few days) and your temporary Net ID. 

3. You will receive two separate emails containing your temporary NetID and your temporary password. Check your spam/junk folder if you do not receive them. You will log back into the same website with this information and register using the instructions below. Approximately 48-72 business hours after your registration you will receive an email with instructions on how activate your permanent NetID. 
 
4. For these purposes, the SU system treats IQMR as a single “class.” Under the class verification section, you will need a five-digit code for the class. You will receive this code in an email from Sebastian. **The deadline to add this class is: May 15, 2025. Participants will not be able to register after this date. **
 
5. After you enter all the information, you should see a payment page. The payment total should be $0 (that is, zero dollars) and click “complete my registration” to finish the process.
 
Please complete your registration and activate your permanent Net ID by May 15. If you encounter any problems or issues, do not try to create yourself again! Please contact the College of Professional Studies Bursar/Registration Office for assistance directly at bursareg@syr.edu or +1-315-443-4135.
