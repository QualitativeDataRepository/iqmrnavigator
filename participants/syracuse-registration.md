title: SUID NUMBER and SU NetID
---


Syracuse University will provide you with two different unique identifiers: your Syracuse University Identification number (SUID number) and your SU NetID. Having both forms of ID is critical for you to access university services, reading materials, and the Internet while on the Syracuse University campus. 
Your SUID number will be included on your SUID card. Your SUID card gives you access to various locations and services such as the gym, library, and other SU facilities. Your SU NetID allows you access to Syracuse University’s digital resources (such as the library). You will need your SUID in order to get your SU NetID.

## Register for your SUID and NetID
You will need to register online in order to get an SUID number and an SU NetID. You will receive your SUID number and SU NetID shortly after you register. You will receive your SUID card when you arrive at IQMR.
Please read the instructions carefully before starting.

 
1. Please click this link to register your Syracuse University Identities: [Non-Credit Instructions for Registration](https://professionalstudies.syracuse.edu/academics/non-credit-class-instructions-for-registration/). Once on the page, click on “Register Now” to begin. 
 
2. After you enter your biographic information (be sure to enter your date of birth in the following order: two-digit MONTH, two-digit DAY, four-digit year), disciplinary history, and additional questions, you will see a personal information confirmation page. This page will contain your SUID number (_**write this down and save it!**_ You will need it to activate your permanent NetID in a few days) and your temporary Net ID. 

3. You will receive two separate emails containing your temporary NetID and your temporary password. Check your spam/junk folder if you do not receive them. You will log back into the same website with this information and register using the instructions below. Approximately 48-72 business hours after your registration you will receive an email with instructions on how activate your permanent NetID.  
 
4. For these purposes, the SU system treats IQMR as a single “class.” Under the class verification section, you will need a five-digit code for the class. You will receive this code in an email from Sebastian. **The deadline to add this class is: May 15, 2026. Participants will not be able to register after this date.**
 
5. After you enter all the information, you should see a payment page. The payment total should be $0 (that is, zero dollars) and click “complete my registration” to finish the process.
 
Please complete your registration and activate your permanent Net ID by May 15. If you encounter any problems or issues, do not try to create yourself again!
