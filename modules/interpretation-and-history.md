What is historical interpretation? In one sense interpretation is a part of all historical analysis. Typically we cannot observe history directly; we learn of it only through documents and artifacts that we have to make sense of. Historical interpretation is not separate from other modes of historical analysis but lies on a continuum. Emphasizing the interpretive aspects of historical analysis means that we do not take at face value the documentary evidence of history we encounter. We question the text as well as its source, we compare narratives, placing them in their historical context, we look for silences and gaps in evidence, as well as voices that may not be heard as easily. Importantly, we also interrogate our own objectives in questioning history and examine the ways in which they may shape our own narratives. Historical interpretation shares with other interpretive methods the search for meaning in subjects’ actions and utterances. But with historical interpretation, the distance of the researcher from the subject matter produces distinctive epistemological challenges and requires a methodological orientation aimed at achieving understanding without the possibility of direct engagement or immersion. In this module sequencecourse we will grapple with some of the dilemmas of historical interpretation including reading history, questioning history, analyzing history, and writing history. We will also engage with enduring epistemological debates about the nature of historical inquiry as well as the challenges of discerning historical lessons.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – SESSION 1: What is history? 

The first dilemma we encounter with historical interpretation is the question of history itself. Is history a set thing in the past or is it a story we tell about the past? Are historical facts found or made? Answers range from traditional historicism (history is there for us to discover), to various forms of constructivism (history is made from the things we discover), and poststructuralism (history is fiction), with many different points in between. We engage with some of these issues in this session with a view to understanding what is at stake in our conception of history and how we might incorporate elements of different views in our own thinking.

### 1:30pm - 3:00pm – SESSION 2: Questioning History

When we turn to history, we seek to understand the past, but our questions invariably come from the present. Therefore, historical interpretation must begin with an examination of our own questions. Where do our questions come from? What are they intended to do? Would these questions have been relevant for the context we seek to examine? Grappling with the questions helps us better orient ourselves to the subject matter and account for the theoretical priors and empirical expectations we have going into the research.

### 3:30pm - 5:00pm – SESSION 3: Reading History

Often the most important source of innovation in historical analysis comes from questioning the received narrative, or the dominant understanding of historical processes as it has been transmitted through the social scientific literature. But how do we do that? Typically what we know about the subject matter comes from the prevalent narrative in our field. Often, the first step is rigorous historiography – looking for alternative interpretations that may have existed previously, looking for competing narratives, challenging each interpretation by questioning the interpreter, and placing the text in its historical specificity. We ask: What kind of narrative is this? Is it a Marxist account, a liberal account? What are the consequences for our own reading of history? Rigorous historiography will often reveal different and competing narratives and we must also consider how to weigh different accounts, including the thorny issue of who has epistemological priority.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – SESSION 1: Analyzing History

Often, we are not just reading history but also using it to make an analytical argument. Within the canon of social science history there have been many approaches developed to leverage historical analysis for scientific knowledge. We will consider three in this section: comparative history, which gravitates toward variable-based nomothetic analysis; the evaluation of ideal types, which offers a more open-ended mode of historical investigation; and geo-history which aims to uncover deeper historical structures and processes. All three approaches reside within the family of comparative

### 1:30pm - 3:00pm – SESSION 2: Writing History

Writing history requires us to construct our own historical narrative, involving varied and seemingly infinite choices about what to include and what not to include. In addition, we must consider: How much (and when) to use secondary vs. primary sources? How much to simplify? How do we offer a credible and convincing account given the things that we must omit? How do we avoid the dreaded “one thing after another” trap? Moreover, writing history is often not a discrete stage but involves a back and forth with reading and analyzing, between theory and evidence. This also presents methodological challenges in terms of how we examine our theoretical propositions. While there is not one single answer to these questions, nor a single historical narrative that will capture history in all its dimensions, being conscious of the choices we make and the basis on which we make them can help improve the rigor and quality of our writing.

**Required readings:**

  - *No readings for this session. Instead, bring to class an historical narrative that you have written on a topic of your choosing. This can be something you have written before or something you write in advance for this exercise. In class you will have some time to annotate your narrative identifying the choices you have made (for example, your choice of questions, cases, sources, which pieces of evidence to include, what is excluded, do you focus on specific historical figures, social actors etc). The goal will be to reflect on and discuss how these choices shape your narrative.* We will also discuss strategies to make historical writing more effective.

### 3:30pm - 5:00pm – SESSION 3: Historys Lessons?

With historical analysis always comes the temptations, promise, and pitfalls of “historical lessons” – the attempt to draw from history parallels, analogies, or models to guide action in the present. How to wield history responsibly has been a matter of considerable debate. In this section we consider several perspectives, from the more conservative to the more critical, and examine more carefully what we might make of history’s lessons.

  - W.E.B Dubois, “The Propaganda of History” in *Black Reconstruction*
