**Marcus Kreuzer (Villanova University)**

We live in a constantly emerging world in which studying changes across time are just as crucial as analyzing differences across cases to understand our contemporary politics. Comparative historical analysis (CHA) has long studied such historical changes and made important contributions to our understanding of how to use time to study the past. It goes back to the 19th century classics and shares more recently its ambitions with American Political Development, historical institutionalism, and a long historical tradition in international relations. These approaches all point out that time is to the past what grammar is to language and maps are to space: an essential tool of analysis. This module explores three distinct contributions that CHA makes to our understanding of time.

  - First, it identifies distinct temporal building blocks that make time analytically tractable. Time scales specify how far into the past we look, chronologies specify the events we analyze, and periodizations make historical contexts comparable. These three building blocks constitute a historical notion of time that asks how different the past is from the present. CHA complements this historical notion of time with three elements of physical, clock-like time: duration, tempo and sequences which help to identify variations in the unfolding of the past.

  - Second, CHA configures historical and physical time in distinct ways that define its three strands: eventful, longue durée, and macro-causal analysis. These strands foreground temporal and historical dynamics that existing explanations often overlook. They use time for exploratory and descriptive strategies to identify a series of macro-historical questions about the origins and transformation of states, regimes, markets, war, social structures, and global relations.

- Third, CHA draws heavily on process tracing to answer macro-historical questions but supplements it by highlighting temporal causal mechanisms (e.g. path dependency, sequencing, intercurrences, diffusion, tipping points) and the role causal diagrams play in the theorizing process.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Thinking Historically: Problematizing History and Geography


CHA is problem driven and presumes that research questions—particularly in an ever-changing world—rarely pose themselves. Identifying research questions requires initial exploration, journalistic-like description, and ultimately establishing a baseline for our understanding of what is going on in a macro-historical phenomenon. Historical thinking plays a central role in this exploratory research stage.

Historians prefer to travel light when they head for the archives, but they nevertheless employ various temporal and spatial units of analysis that help them identify patterns and formulate research questions. Historical thinking provides a broader ontological map for these units of analysis that guide exploration. Moreover, historical thinking problematizes existing accounts by looking at the same phenomena from different temporal and spatial lenses. This kaleidoscoping pivoting foregrounds contextual factors, helps identify confounders, or otherwise generate new inductive insights. This module illustrates the pay-offs of historical thinking by contrasting it with statistical thinking that backgrounds contextual complexities behind scope conditions to create a more orderly, numerical tractable, and testable world.

### 1:30pm - 3:00pm – Thinking Temporally: Varieties of Time

Thinking historically involves thinking temporally. Historical thinking appears at first sight to involve a serendipitous and largely unsystematic sleuthing. On closer analysis, it is structured by deploying two notions of time—historical and physical time—as well as a specific temporal vocabulary. Temporal thinking does not come naturally and requires mastering this temporal vocabulary, just as statistics requires mastering probability theory. This session differentiates between four notions of historical time: cyclical, bounded, serial and eventful. Each notion freezes history to a different degree, foregrounds varying levels of contextual complexity, and serves distinct methodological purposes.

The session then pivots to discussing five elements of physical time: tempo, duration, timing, sequencing, and stages. These mechanical, clock-like elements of physical time play a dual role in CHA. First, they serve to capture the more context independent elements of historical change and thereby better understand its differing rhythms. Second, they also serve to unfreeze, linear notions of causality (i.e. potential outcomes, average treatment effect) and elucidate more historical notions of causality.

### 3:30pm - 5:00pm – Eventful Analysis: Identifying Patterns Of (Dis-)continuity

Eventful analysis is the most interpretivist, descriptive, and exploratory strand of CHA. It tries to establish what is going on, elucidate existing concepts, and identify historical continuities and discontinuities. It employs the most unfrozen notion of historical time—eventful history—and draws on physical time to analyze the rhythms at which history unfolds. Eventful analysis is deeply embedded in global history, diplomatic history, global historical sociology, constructivist international relations theory, American Political Development, historical institutionalism, the history of the welfare state, postcolonialism, and race and gender studies.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Longue Durée Analysis: Temporal Broadening and Exploring 


James Scott observed that “once you elongate the time horizon, things start to move”. Such temporal broadening is the hallmark longue durée analysis that explores longer-term, slower moving patterns of historical change. It is the least developed strand of CHA. It is used by economic historians, demographers, evolutionary psychologists, and historians influenced by the French Annals school. It often employs time series data and leverages various data visualization tools to identify long-term trends. Longue durée analysis plays a particularly important role in shifting the analysis from, what Paul Pierson called, short/short explanations to explanations with more long-term temporal perspectives. It also partially overlaps with historical political economy, a more recent entrant to historical social science.

### 1:30pm - 3:00pm – Grounding Explanations Theoretically


Despite its emphasis on exploration, CHA remains committed to advancing theoretically grounded explanations that are empirically validated in a transparent and replicable fashion. However, given its commitment to placing questions before methods, CHA is unwilling to define itself in terms of a single causal inference strategy. It draws heavily on process tracing to make causally complex inferences. It complements process tracing in three distinct ways. It highlights temporal causal mechanisms (e.g. path dependency, sequencing, intercurrences, diffusion, tipping points), emphasizes theory’s role in updating findings across interactive research cycles, and stresses the value of using causal graphs to visualize explanations. The module highlights CHA style process tracing with experimental and quasi-experimental research designs. These designs are capable of estimating causal effects by background many of the contextual complexities that CHA foregrounds.

### 3:30pm - 5:00pm – Conclusion: CHA and “Angry Science” 


CHA does not impose parameters or scope conditions so that it can explore context in its full complexity. It treats the discoveries of this exploration as inductive insights that help to update theories. This exploration and updating are highly theoretical activities. CHA, following historians, uses theory to problematize existing explanations. Problematizing involves shifting theoretical frames or changing your temporal or spatial units of analysis to foreground different sets of causal factors. CHA also depends on theory to integrate new inductive insights into existing theories, when appropriate, or construct entirely new theories. The paper on Sweden’s PR adoption illustrates this abductive updating process.

Towards the end his career, Daniel Kahneman became increasingly troubled by the unwillingness of scholars to update their beliefs and the professional incentive structure that reinforced this theoretical obstinacy. He contended that this intransigence contributed to “angry science”. CHA’s heterodoxy offers a template for what Kahneman called adversarial collaboration. This concluding module shows how CHA offers a more integrative approach to social inquiry. It evaluates its potential to reduce angry science by offering a more even balance between exploration and confirmation and emphasizing the interactive and theory-guided nature of knowledge production..
