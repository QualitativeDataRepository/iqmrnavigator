{: #module-date}

**Diana Kapiszewski (Georgetown University), Lauren M. MacLean (Northeastern University), and Rob Mickey (University of Michigan), and Jessie Trudeau (Syracuse University)**

This module sequence discusses strategies for designing, planning, and conducting fieldwork in the social sciences. We begin by considering the multiple aspects of preparing for field research, and then discuss some practical elements – with intellectual implications – of operating in the field. On the second day we talk through key questions relating to research ethics – the importance of which is discussed throughout the module sequence – and consider two “more-interactive” forms of data collection, surveys and interviews. The third module continues the discussion of interview techniques, and also covers focus groups, as well as the types of observation in which all social scientists who conduct field research engage. Finally, the fourth module considers the conduct of archival research, and the various ways in which scholars iterate on their research design and field research design as they conduct fieldwork. Each session of each module is conducted with the understanding that participants have carefully read the assigned materials. The instructors present key points drawing on the assigned readings, other published work on field research, and the experiences they and others have had with managing fieldwork's diverse challenges. Interaction and discussion in small and large groups is encouraged.

## Preparing for Fieldwork and Operating in the Field (M1 June 16) 
{: .module-sub }

This module introduces the fieldwork module sequence, considering the structure of the modules and presenting some of the overarching themes we will consider over the next three days. The module then begins to discuss the design, planning, and execution of field research. We offer strategies for addressing the intellectual, social, emotional, health, and logistical challenges that carrying out field research can involve. Each session is conducted with the understanding that participants have carefully read the assigned materials. The instructors present key points drawing on the assigned readings, other published work on field research, and the experiences they and others have had with managing fieldwork’s diverse challenges. Interaction and discussion in small and large groups is encouraged.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Borders and Varieties of Fieldwork

**Diana Kapiszewski and Lauren M. MacLean**

This session introduces the fieldwork modules, outlining their structure and identifying some underlying themes that we will consider throughout the three days of the module sequence, including questions of positionality and power, and the similarities and differences between digital and traditional fieldwork. We discuss our conception of field research as entailing repeated shifts among research design, data collection, and data analysis, consider some of the implications of these shifts, and evaluate the benefits of iterating on one’s research design. We consider fieldwork’s heterogeneity (how it varies across contexts, researchers, projects, and points of time in the same project), begin to reflect on the diverse challenges that fieldwork entails, and discuss the importance of conducting fieldwork with research ethics continuously in mind.

## Research Ethics, Surveys, and Interviews (M5, June 17)
{: .module-sub }

This module begins with a discussion of research ethics. The rest of the sessions of this module and the first two of the following module in this sequence consider a range of “more-interactive” data-collection techniques, i.e., techniques in which information is obtained or generated through interacting with people. We discuss surveys and focus groups, and conclude with two sessions on interviewing. We consider both the digital and traditional forms of all of these techniques, and the ethical underpinnings of each.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Research Ethics

**Diana Kapiszewski, Lauren M. MacLean, and Jessie Trudeau**
Research ethics form the bedrock of all social science inquiry. We consider when and how ideas about research ethics in the social sciences developed and became formalized, and discuss the rules and organizations that guide and regulate research ethics in the social sciences. We also think through the various dimensions of ethics in practice, and reasons why social scientists may design, conduct, and disseminate research more or less ethically. We argue that research that is conducted ethically is better research, and consider three pathways through which the ethical conduct of inquiry strengthens research and foments the cumulation of knowledge: contextualization, reflexivity and transparency.

## Interviews, Focus Groups, and Observation (M9, June 18)
{: .module-sub }

This module continues to consider “more-interactive” data-collection techniques, i.e., techniques in which information is obtained or generated through interacting with people. We continue the discussion of interviews, and then consider focus groups. The module concludes by emphasizing the importance of reflexive observation in the field. We consider the ethical underpinnings of all of these techniques, and consider both digital and traditional forms.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Interviews

**Diana Kapiszewski**

This session continues the discussion of interviewing begun in the previous module. We consider a range of choices and challenges involved in conducting interviews and following-up thereafter, options for capturing interview data, and the evidentiary strengths and weaknesses of interview data. ..conduct, and follow-up after one-on-one interviews. Participants will have the opportunity to create various tools for use in their own research, including a research pitch and an informed consent script, and sample interview questions.

## Archival Research and Dynamic Research Design (M13, June 20)
{: .module-sub }

This module begins with a discussion of a preeminent less-interactive form of fieldwork – archival research – considering its conduct in both digital and traditional forms. The module concludes with a consideration of the multiple strategies scholars can adopt in order to engage in analysis and assess their progress in the field. We consider the “iterative” nature of research design and field research design, why design is iterative, and what measures can be taken so that iteration does not undermine inference.

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Archival Research I

**Rob Mickey**

This session introduces participants to the process of planning and conducting fieldwork aimed at collecting and analyzing archival evidence, remote- access archival research, and digitized sources. Where, when and how does one start? What does one actually *do* at an archive? What are concrete strategies for time management, navigating materials, note-taking, and organizing and storing evidence?
