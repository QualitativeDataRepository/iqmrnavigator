**Thursday, June 26; Friday, June 27**

**Jonnell Robinson (Syracuse University)**

This module sequence introduces participants to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a tool for social science research. Hands-on sessions teach participants basic GIS mapping and spatial analysis techniques and principles of map visualization, particularly the tools that are most commonly used by social scientists. Sessions explore basic visualization and analytical functions such as building and displaying attribute table data on maps and mapping distributions and concentrations as multiple scales. The module also reviews the types and sources of data that are available for GIS users, the ethics of using mapping in research, and how to effectively communicate mapped data using professional cartographic design standards.. Other sessions introduce open source geovisualization and analysis tools including Open Street Map, Google My Maps, and QGIS; demonstrate data collection techniques for archival research, field work, participatory and community‐based mapping, and information about how and where to further hone GIS mapping and spatial analysis skills.

***Participants may enter the module sequence after it has begun, but their doing so is discouraged.***

### 8:45am - 10:15am – Enhancing Qualitative Social Science Research with GIS

This first session of six introduces participants to some of the ways that mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can enhance a range of qualitative and quantitative research approaches and methodologies. Using housing as a hypothetical research area, the session demonstrates ways to examine housing access using spatial data visualization and analysis. During the hands-on portion of the session, participants will learn the interface of

ESRI’s ArcPro, a leading GIS mapping software.
