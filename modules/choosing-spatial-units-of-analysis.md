title: Choosing Spatial Units of Analysis (Module 19)
---

Monday, June 23

**Hillel David Soifer (UC Berkeley)**

Recent decades have seen major advances in the methodology of both qualitative and quantitative research, as scholarship has become much more purposive and precise both about the selection of cases and about the analysis of the data generated in the investigation of those cases. Yet the selection of cases and analysis of data is predicated on a prior, less studied, research design choice: the identification of the spatial unit of analysis. This issue, moreover, is no small detail: as geographers have shown, phenomena vary according to how spatial units are defined - this is what is known as the modifiable areal unit problem. As the size, shape, and location of the borders of a spatial unit change, the association we will find between social and political phenomena that we seek to study will change in fundamentally unpredictable ways. Indeed, even studies of individual-level attributes and behavior that seek to control for characteristics of context will be affected by how the researcher chooses to draw the boundaries within which context is measured. In short, the spatial units we choose affect the answers we get, and even the questions we ask. Yet even as the discipline of geography has been roiled by this issue for several decades, cognate social science disciplines have not grappled with it. The result is that we have little guidance for choosing an appropriate unit of analysis, and little sense of how choices about the units of analysis in existing studies might shape findings we take as robust instantiations of conventional wisdom. This module will explore these issues. We will first outline the depth of the problem in terms of the threats it poses to inference, and the range of scholarship to which it potentially applies. We will then turn to the role of theory in justifying the validity of the spatial units that we choose, and to ways to demonstrate the reliability of our findings through empirical analysis. Participants will have the opportunity to work through issues in their own research designs in addition to exploring the implications of this problem for their confidence in the findings of existing research in their areas of interest.

### 8:45am - 10:15am –The stakes of choosing spatial units


This session will explore the little-understood but fundamental ways in which the spatial units we choose affect the conclusions we draw from our analyses - this is the concern known to geographers as the ‘modifiable areal unit problem’. It will show that these effects are not only substantively important but deeply unpredictable. Since previous work on this question (in the discipline of geography) has focused on the quantitative setting, our discussion will begin there, but we will move to the ways in which these impacts unsettle our confidence in the conclusions of qualitative research as well.

### 1:30pm - 3:00pm – a menu of responses to the MAUP


This module will explore a set of ways in which scholars can respond to the concerns raised by the modifiable areal unit problem. It will emphasize the primary role of conceptual and theoretical precision in attenuating the threats to inference that it poses, show some complementary empirical strategies that scholars can use, and highlight some intuitive-seeming but ineffective responses.

### 3:30pm - 5:00pm – Collaborative research design

This module will apply the lessons from the previous two modules to an empirical setting - we will work together to design multi-method research projects intended to explain subnational variation in violence in contemporary Mexico. We will begin by working together to determine which research questions we seek to ask, and then consider how we should choose the appropriate spatial unit of analysis to operationalize our study. The instructor will provide a brief introduction to the case, and some data that can be used to design a research project, so there are no required readings for this exercise. After completing this exercise, we will turn to discussion of participants’ research projects and how they might approach them given the issues raised in preceding modules.
