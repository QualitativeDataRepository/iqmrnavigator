How can ethnographic methods inform the study of politics? The immersive, meaning-centric, everyday-life focus that ethnographic methods offer affords social scientists insight into processes, practices, and understandings of political worlds that might otherwise remain hidden or obscure. Sometimes portrayed as “a craft” rather than “a method” or caricatured as “just hanging out,” the research approaches we explore in the Ethnographic Methods sequence explore ethnography’s immense potential in the study of power and politics. It addresses questions such as: What commitments does an ethnographic researcher make to herself, her interlocutors, the communities she studies, and to the discipline? What are the various ways in which a researcher can situate herself in a research practice where she is fundamentally the instrument? How does a researcher develop a robust ethnographic approach to a project, whether in the pursuit of writing an ethnography or as part of a multi-method endeavor? What types of data or evidence do those leveraging ethnographic methods generate, through which methods, and how do they analyse them? How have ethnographers challenged, expanded, and innovated upon the presumed fundamentals of ethnography?

***Participants may enter the module sequence after it has begun.***


## Preparation (required): 
{: .module-sub }

Before coming to IQMR, spend at least four hours intentionally observing and/or participating in, and then reflecting on a community, group, space, place, behavior, or cultural practice. Take detailed notes on what you observe and what you experience. Feel free to explore any overarching patterns, themes, hypotheses, or understandings that emerge over the course of your notes.

  - There must be **no reasonable expectation of privacy at your site**, or among the individuals who you may observe. One way to ensure this is to choose to conduct your observations in a public space, meaning that there are no formal, institutional, or legal barriers to access (e.g., no permission, application, ID required, or sign-up/sign-in required).

  - The site that you choose to observe must be **low-risk for you and for participants**. Remember, ethnography embraces the presence of politics in the everyday and the banal.

  - **You must engage only in observation or public participation.** This exercise asks you to practice observation. Your goal is to work on **noticing** aspects of the everyday through the eyes of a social scientist. **Absolutely no interviews or focus groups may be conducted for this exercise.**

  - **Before beginning observation**, please write the following document and send it to the instructors for sign off ([sparkinson@jhu.edu](mailto:sparkinson@jhu.edu) and [kbond@binghamton.edu](mailto:kbond@binghamton.edu)). You should not begin the observation portion of the exercise without sign off. Please then bring this document and your notes with you to the module meetings:
    
      - An approximately half-page document detailing the logic of your siting, the behaviors/processes you intend to observe, and the populations you expect to be present, and any advance expectations or assumptions you have regarding what you will observe.
    
      - An approximately half-page document detailing your understanding of the risks, costs, and potential safety and security complications associated with your choice of a site and topical focus.

  - Previous, group versions of this exercise have resulted in students being approached, detained, or otherwise surveilled by public law enforcement or private security agents for the appearance of note taking or otherwise “suspicious-looking” behaviors. These incidents occurred at shopping malls. However, they could take place in any number of locations and could involve actors other than law enforcement. This is one reality of observational/immersive research that we will discuss further in class. Keep this reality in mind as you plan your work.

  - Understand that any notes you take do not qualify as human subjects research, do not have IRB approval, are not legally protected from subpoena, and could be used as evidence against you or those you observe by authorities. Please use this knowledge to inform your choice of observation site.

## Ethnographic Methods II: Design, Technique, and Practice (M24, June 24)
{: .module-sub }


### 8:45–10:15am – Siting ethnography and ethnographic work 

  - Format: Interactive lecture + Siting Exercise (Small Groups) + Discussion

  - Summary: This session explores the logics of ethnographic siting. In contrast to approaches to fieldwork that assume cases exist “out there,” the class will discuss strategies for seeing and observing politics in everyday life. A group exercise will ask students to creatively brainstorm physical or social sites for studies of various political dynamics and behaviors. Students will also begin to analyze their preparatory work, beginning with: Where did you go, and what did you intend to observe? How and why did you choose your site of immersion?

### 1:30-3:00pm – On the Ground: (Participant) Observation in (Collective) Action 

  - Format: Lecture + Discussion + Writing Activity (field notes and field journals)

Summary: Drawing on ethnographic work on collective action and protest, the instructors will walk students through various approaches to on-the-ground (participant) observation. How have scholars approached (participant) observation in protests and regarding collective action? Students will then be asked to continue analysis of their own preparatory work, considering questions such as: What is the relationship between space, place, and action in your research site? How would you describe your observation “style”? Did your presence influence what and how you observe, or in what and how you participated?

### 8:45–10:15am – Placing ethnography: Designing multi-method(ological) projects

  - Format: Lecture + Small Group Activity (workshop your research design to make it multi-method or multi-epistemological)
