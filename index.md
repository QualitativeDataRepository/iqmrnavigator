## Welcome to IQMR 2025

Welcome to the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (IQMR), and welcome to the "Navigator" website for IQMR 2025!

IQMR is a two-week training program that takes place each June at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. Each year approximately 160 graduate students and junior faculty from all over the United States and around the world attend IQMR. Between 25-30 instructors join us each summer. Most attendees are advanced graduate students or junior faculty in various social science disciplines (with an emphasis on political science).

The Institute explores the techniques, uses, strengths, and limitations of qualitative methods, while emphasizing their relationships with alternative approaches. IQMR also seeks to enable participants to create and critique methodologically sophisticated qualitative research designs, including case studies, tests of necessity or sufficiency, and narrative or interpretive work. Attendees present and receive constructive feedback on their own research designs.

Founded more than 20 years ago, IQMR has now trained more than 3,000 participants who continue to use, teach, and develop qualitative methods and techniques for combining qualitative methods with other forms of inquiry. More information can be found [on the IQMR web site](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/center-for-qualitative-and-multi-method-inquiry/institute-for-qualitative-multi-method-research).

This website is designed to help IQMR instructors and participants to "navigate" IQMR. It includes information about every aspect of the Institute, substantive and logistical. If you cannot find a piece of information you need on Navigator, please let Sebastian Karcher ([skarcher@maxwell.syr.edu](mailto:skarcher@syr.edu)) or Diana Kapiszewski ([dk784@georgetown.edu](mailto:dk784@georgetown.edu)) know! The site is a work in progress, and we want to make it as useful to everyone as we can!
