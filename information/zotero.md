title: Zotero for IQMR Material
---

IQMR uses a Zotero group for access to all readings as well as research
designs and session slides. We will gradually make materials available
and hope to have all readings available by June 1.

## The Essentials

  - > Zotero is a free reference management software.
  - > You *can*, but do not have to, download and install the Zotero
    > software.
  - > IQMR’s Zotero library is a private Zotero group. That means only
    > people we add to the group will have access to the resources.
  - > If you are already using Zotero, we recommend that you just use
    > your existing account to access IQMR resources rather than
    > registering for a new one.
  - > If you aren’t already using Zotero, you *will* need to register
    > for a Zotero account to access IQMR resources (see below)..
  - > We are collecting your Zotero username in the same survey through
    > which you upload your research design.
  - > The Zotero group will remain available for 6 months after IQMR.
    > Your access will be removed on December 31st, 2025.
  - > You **must not share** any resources from the IQMR Zotero group
    > with anyone who did not attend the institute. Much of the readings
    > provided, e.g., are under copyright and we do not have permission
    > to share them further.
  - > You can copy any materials from the Zotero group to your personal
    > Zotero library simply by dragging and dropping them. These copies
    > will stay available to you after your access to the IQMR Zotero
    > group is removed.
  - > Zotero offers a limited amount of free online storage for files.
    > The materials in the IQMR Zotero group do not count against your
    > storage quota. Any materials you copy to your personal library do
    > count against your Zotero storage.

## Registering for a Zotero Account

If you don’t already have a Zotero account, you can register quickly and
for free [on the Zotero
website](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). We recommend that
you use your institutional email address to register for Zotero (some
institutions provide their users free unlimited Zotero storage).

## Accessing the IQMR Zotero Group

As part of the survey through which you submit your research design, you
will provide us with your Zotero username. If you don’t remember your
username, you can find it in the [Zotero
settings](https://www.zotero.org/settings). We will then invite
you to the IQMR 2025 Zotero group, typically within 48 hours. You will
receive the invitation by email. If you believe you should have received
an invitation but haven’t, also check your
[inbox on the Zotero
website](https://forums.zotero.org/messages/inbox).

Click the link to join/learn more about the group in the invitation and
then the “Join” button on the right of the group’s page (see
screenshot).

Once you have joined the group, you [can access
it
online](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5976232/iqmr2025/library).
If you are using the Zotero software, the group will also appear in the
app (see below).

## Finding Resources in the IQMR Zotero Group

We have organized all materials by day. Each day has a collection with
subcollections for each module, which in turn has subcollections for
required readings, slides, and suggested readings (if there are any).
Not all of these resources may be available when you first access
Zotero. If they are not, keep returning to Zotero to check if the
materials have been completed.

Note that you can also use Zotero’s search function to search for
specific works by title or author.

## Using the Zotero Desktop Software (optional)

If you want to take full advantage of all of Zotero’s fabulous
functionality, you need to use its Desktop software. You
[can download
Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) for free for your
operating system. Zotero installs like any other app on Windows and Mac
(if you are having trouble or using Linux, see
[the installation
instructions.](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation))

Many people find Zotero very intuitive to use. If you want to learn more
or are wondering about something specific, Zotero provides
[lots of
documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/) for the software.
You can also find videos and getting started guides at many libraries,
e.g. [here from the Harvard
Libraries](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/zotero).

Once you have joined the IQMR 2026 Zotero group, the group will become
available in your local Zotero app [when it
syncs](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync). If you are not
already syncing Zotero, the app will prompt you to set sync up with your
username and password or you can enable sync in the preferences. When
you have synced, the IQMR 2026 group will appear at the left, below your
personal library, and sorted alphabetically among any other Zotero
groups you may have.
