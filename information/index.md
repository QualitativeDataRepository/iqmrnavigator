Research Design Discussion Groups
---------------------------------

All IQMR participants present a research design for feedback and critique by participant peers. Research design discussion groups are held for 1 hour and 15 minutes on most mornings of the Institute. The Instructor Information and Participant Information pages have more information about [writing and presenting a research design](/participants/research-design-instructions) (participants) and [chairing research design sessions](/instructors/chairing-research-design) (instructors). Find here a [short version of the research design session schedule](/information/research-design-schedule), including room numbers. The detailed schedule is available to participants [on Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5976232/iqmr/collections/498N3CAN/items/B8XI2BVR/collection) and faculty on Dropbox.

## IQMR Facebook

The IQMR Facebook has names, images (unless opting out), affiliations, and email addresses of all IQMR 2025 participants and staff. Participants can review a draft version on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5976232/iqmr/collections/498N3CAN/items/B8XI2BVR/collection) and faculty can review a draft version on Dropbox and request changes. The final version is made available in the IQMR Zotero group shortly before the Institute.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
------

Syracuse University Department of Public Safety (DPS), the campus police, is available 24/7 at 315.443.2224. You can also reach DPS by dialing #78 (#SU) from your cell phone, or by utilizing the [Orange Safe app](https://dps.syr.edu/services-resources/orange-safe-app/){:target="_blank"}.

If you become ill and would like to see a medical professional, you can go to the [WellNow Urgent Care](https://www.wellnow.com/urgent-care-centers/new-york/syracuse/1600-erie-blvd-e-13210), which is located at 1600 Erie Boulevard East, (315) 401-3204.  


### MEDICAL INSURANCE

Visitors from abroad are strongly encouraged to check with their home institutions to determine whether they will be covered for any medical costs and expenses they may incur should they fall ill or have an accident while in the United States. If not, you are strongly encouraged to purchase health insurance in your home country that will cover you in the United States for the complete duration of your stay in the event of illness or injury. Medical care in the United States is expensive, and we recommend that you secure health insurance coverage to protect against exorbitant costs.

Visitors from U.S. universities should check with their health offices to ensure you are covered when away from campus and in June, and to make sure you have necessary paperwork to evidence that coverage. If you are not covered, we again strongly encourage you to purchase insurance for your time in Syracuse.

### COVID-19 Protocol

IQMR has masks available, which you should feel free to wear if you wish. (If the number of reported cases increases, we will encourage you, or potentially require you to wear masks.) We also have free rapid tests available at no cost to participants. If you begin to feel even slightly sick, please test immediately for COVID. If you test positive, notify IQMR staff immediately. Participants with COVID will isolate in their room in Milton Hall and  will not be able to attend IQMR sessions in-person, but will be able to participate remotely (we will provide you with Zoom information).
