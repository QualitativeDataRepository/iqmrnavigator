title: Eggers Hall and Maxwell Hall

---

Almost all events will be held at Eggers and Maxwell Hall, please utilize these maps to help you navigate classroom and event locations. 

Both buildings are connected by a hallway on the first, second, and third floors. Maxwell Hall is the original home of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. In 1993, the school expanded with the completion of Eggers Hall, which was linked to Maxwell Hall via an enclosed hallway and commons space. As you walk between the two buildings on any of the connected floors, you can identify the transition by observing the preserved exterior facade of Maxwell Hall, which visibly marks the separation between the original structure and the addition of Eggers. 

## Water Fountains and Bottle Stations
Water fountains are located on every floor of Eggers Hall next to the elevator and restrooms. A bottle refilling station is also available on the first floor beside the water fountain, and an additional bottle refilling station is located at the far end of Maxwell Hall -- past the Maxwell Auditorium and before the doors leading down toward Milton Hall.
